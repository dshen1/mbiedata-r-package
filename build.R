# Note - set the library path so the Test folder is listed first and the installation will be to there,
# rather than to the folder used for libraries by everyone.  This should be done in the .Rprofile
# but in case not you can always run the line below:
.libPaths(c("P:/r/libraries/AAA TEST LIBRARIES", .libPaths()))


# Import any data waiting in the staging area to be imported
source("import_from_staging_area.R")

# Build the package:
  build(pkg="pkg", path= "P:/OTSP/data-infrastructure/archive/", binary=TRUE)
